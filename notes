User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
number gets selected: store value in mathHold
then math gets selected: set mathType to whatever was clicked
once second number is selected  the math is done and that becomes the current value :
use mathHoldOne to hold the first value clicked then have second num go to mathHoldTWo

basic stuff done
now need to make it so when another math button is hit the currently mathtype.type executues math1 becomes that numthe mahttype updates and numtwo goes to 0
